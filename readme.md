## This is kernel for PostmarketOS! Not Android.

## What is condition of kernel?
Okay, so kernel is compiling and working, but as trying to setup config for Docker, it's not working (stuck on vendor logo, without USB network). So IDK how to fix it. (kernel without this options works fine)
## Wi-Fi works?
As it is now, no, it's doesn't work (still trying to fix firmware errors)
## Bluetooth?
IDK really
## Display + touch?
Yep, it's working just fine
## DRM (for Plasma Touch)?
Nope, I can't even enable this option. It doesn't even show up in the configuration. (?)
